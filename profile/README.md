NexOps Protocol is an AI-assisted, security-first infrastructure layer designed to accelerate and harden smart contract development on Bitcoin Cash.

As BCH smart contracts and CashTokens adoption grow, the ecosystem requires stronger guardrails, better auditing, and safer deployment workflows. NexOps provides deterministic enforcement, hybrid security scoring, and developer-grade tooling — ensuring that more contracts can be created without increasing systemic risk.

## 🌍 Why NexOps Matters for the BCH Ecosystem

Bitcoin Cash enables expressive UTXO-based smart contracts through CashScript and covenants — but:

- Small logic errors can permanently lock funds  
- Authority misconfiguration can inflate tokens  
- UTXO reasoning is difficult for new developers  
- Auditing requires deep VM expertise  
- Growth in visual/AI tools increases deployment risk  

NexOps reduces these risks while increasing contract velocity.

> More contracts deployed.  
> Fewer contracts broken.  
> Higher trust in BCH DeFi infrastructure.

## 🚀 Ecosystem-Oriented Capabilities

### 🧠 Guarded AI Contract Generation  
Converts natural language intent into structured, readable CashScript — enforced through a deterministic multi-phase synthesis pipeline.

### 🛡️ Hybrid Security Scoring (70/30 Model)  
Combines structural rule enforcement (0–70) with semantic business logic evaluation (0–30), producing a transparent security score before deployment.

### ⚙️ Deterministic Deployment Guardrails  
Typed constructor validation, secp256k1 checks, and real-time contract address derivation before funding.

### 🧭 Contract Visual Flow Engine  
Auto-generated spend-path diagrams and AI contract explanations to improve transparency and onboarding.

### 🔗 Unified On-Chain Operations  
WalletConnect v2 integration, UTXO monitoring, advanced transaction builder, and real-time Electrum synchronization.

### 🏛️ Verified Global Registry  
One-click publishing of audited contracts, reusable community blueprints, and embedded security reports — promoting composability and shared trust.

---

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

NexOps is built as modular infrastructure designed for long-term ecosystem integration.

### 🖥️ Nexus Workbench
Developer IDE for generation, auditing, simulation, and deployment.

### 🧠 NexOps MCP (Intelligence Core)
Centralized guarded synthesis and security enforcement engine.

### 🔌 Future NexMCP SDK
Public endpoints:
- `/generate`
- `/audit`
- `/repair`

Enabling:
- Wallet integration  
- DAO tooling integration  
- CI/CD contract validation  
- Third-party dApp embedding  

NexOps is not just a UI — it is becoming programmable infrastructure.

# 🧠 NexOps MCP  
### *Deterministic Intelligence for Secure BCH Covenants*

NexOps MCP is the authoritative enforcement layer of the ecosystem.

It separates:
- Structural correctness  
- Business logic safety  
- Deployment eligibility  

Ensuring unsafe contracts never reach mainnet.

---

## 🔐 Hybrid Security Model

### Deterministic Layer (0–70)
- 15 enforced LNC structural invariants  
- Sum preservation  
- Mint authority validation  
- Token category + amount checks  
- Division-by-zero protection  
- Timelock normalization  

### Semantic Layer (0–30)
- Business logic fairness  
- Deadlock detection  
- Incentive alignment review  
- Risk tier classification  

### 🚦 Deployment Gate

Contracts must satisfy:


Deterministic Score ≥ 50
AND
Total Score ≥ 75


This ensures BCH mainnet exposure is risk-filtered.

---

## 📊 Impact on BCH Growth

NexOps improves:

- Developer onboarding  
- Contract safety transparency  
- Reusable audited patterns  
- Confidence in CashToken-based systems  
- Speed of DeFi experimentation  

As more developers build on BCH, NexOps acts as a safety multiplier rather than a risk amplifier.

---
